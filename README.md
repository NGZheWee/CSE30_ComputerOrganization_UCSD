# CSE30: Computer Organization & Systems Programming (Fall 2021, UCSD)

This repository contains coursework from **CSE30: Computer Organization & Systems Programming**, which I took in Fall 2021 at UC San Diego. The course covers fundamental concepts of computer organization, low-level programming, and systems programming using C.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments that focus on low-level programming in C, assembly language, and system-level operations.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Computer Organization**: Understanding the components of a computer system including the CPU, memory, and I/O.
- **Assembly Language**: Writing and understanding programs in assembly language for low-level interaction with hardware.
- **Systems Programming**: Using C for system-level programming, memory management, and handling processes.
- **Data Representation**: Binary and hexadecimal number systems, data types, and representation in memory.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory addressing.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: You can find all homework assignments under the `Homework/` directory, each containing relevant code and documentation that explores topics like memory management, assembly programming, and systems-level operations.
